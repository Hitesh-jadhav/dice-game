# 🎲 Dice Game

A **Provably Fair Dice Game** built with **React (Next.js)** for the frontend and **Node.js (Express)** for the backend. Players can place bets, roll the dice, and verify the fairness of each roll using cryptographic hashing.

## 🌐 Live Demo

- **Frontend**: [https://dice-game-fe.onrender.com/](https://dice-game-fe.onrender.com/)
- **Backend**: [https://dice-game-be.onrender.com/api/roll-dice](https://dice-game-be.onrender.com/api/roll-dice)

### Analysis of Live Services
- **Frontend**:
  - Hosted on Render with a sleek dark theme and responsive layout.
  - Players can enter a bet, roll the dice, and see immediate results.
  - Incorporates a “Provably Fair” mechanism via a `Verify Roll` or displayed cryptographic hash.

- **Backend**:
  - A RESTful API endpoint at `/api/roll-dice` (POST).
  - Expects JSON data like `{ betAmount, currentBalance }`.
  - Responds with roll results, new balance, and cryptographic data (`serverSeed`, `nonce`, `hash`).

## 📜 Features

1. **Provably Fair System**  
   Each roll is verified using **SHA-256** hashing to ensure transparency and fairness.

2. **Responsive UI**  
   - Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

3. **Simple Gameplay**  
   - **Place a bet.**  
   - **Roll the dice.**  
   - **Win** if the roll is 4, 5, or 6 (2× payout).  
   - **Lose** if the roll is 1, 2, or 3 (bet is deducted).

4. **Reset Balance**  
   - Reset your balance to the default amount at any time.

5. **Verify Roll**  
   - Use the cryptographic data (hash, server seed, nonce) to confirm the fairness of each roll.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. [Download it here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dice-game.git
cd dice-game
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Backend
#### 1. Navigate to the server folder:
```bash
cd server
```
#### 2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
#### 3. Start the backend server:
```bash
node index.js
```
#### The backend will run on http://localhost:3001.

### Step 3: Set Up the Frontend

#### 1. Navigate to the client folder:
```bash
cd ../client
```
#### 2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
#### 3. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
#### The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000.

### Step 4: Play the Game
1. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.
2. Enter a bet amount and click Roll Dice.
3. Check the result and verify the roll using the cryptographic data.

## 🧩 Components
### Frontend

1. Balance: Displays the player's wallet balance and address.
2. BetInput: Handles the bet amount input.
3. DiceLine: Displays the dice numbers (1-6) and highlights the result.
4. RollButton: Handles the dice roll action.
5. Reset Button: Resets the balance to the default amount.
6. Verify Button: Verifies the fairness of the roll.

### Backend
1. /api/roll-dice:
   - Accepts a POST request with betAmount and currentBalance.
   - Returns the roll result, new balance, and cryptographic data (server seed, nonce, hash).

## Provably Fair System
The game uses SHA-256 hashing to ensure fairness. Here’s how it works:
1. Server Seed: A random seed generated by the server.
2. Nonce: A unique value (e.g., timestamp) for each roll.
3. Hash: SHA-256 hash of serverSeed + nonce.
4. Roll Calculation:
   - The first 8 characters of the hash are converted to a number.
   - The roll result is calculated using this number.

Players can verify the roll by comparing the hash with the server seed and nonce.

---

##🛠️ Customization
- Change Default Balance:
  - Update the wallet.balance the initial state in the frontend code.
- Modify Payout Rules:
  - Update the roll calculation logic in the backend (server/index.js).
